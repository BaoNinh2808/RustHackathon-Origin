## Problem

In the digital age, protecting copyright for digital products and addressing digital manipulation are critical concerns. Images, videos, and audio files can be easily copied and distributed without permission, leading to piracy and revenue loss for creators. Manipulating digital content, from simple edits like brightness adjustments to advanced AI techniques such as deepfakes and chipfakes, poses significant challenges. These sophisticated manipulations can create highly realistic yet fabricated content, raising serious ethical and legal issues.

## Project Ideas

Create a system allowing users and creators to register their digital products (images, videos, audio, text) and receive a **certificate** of ownership. This **certificate** would be embedded into the product's data to verify its integrity when needed.

Certificate purpose:
 - Authenticate that the individual has registered the product as the origin.
 - Verify the integrity of data in the product (image, video,...). 

Certificate then store in the blockchain for the decentralize storage, transparent data and immutable one.

And when own the certificate, user can exchange this for the profit in the exchange market (certificate now like a NFT)
